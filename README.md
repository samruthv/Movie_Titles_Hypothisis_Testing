Hypothesis testing using chi-squared test to understand which countries lean towards making certain types of rated titles

# Netflix Title's Hypothesis Test

## Introduction about background:

I am a very big fan of film and TV and was able to find a dataset on Kaggle that showed information of all the Netflix titles. I also think that TV is a cultural representation of different people just as art is. If we investigate this data, we can to an extent understand what the different cultures are like. I wanted to use this dataset to get a deeper understanding of the difference in American and foreign TV. I will be performing a Chi squared test between the country the title was made and rating of the title.

## Why is this business problem interesting?

We can see if countries lean towards making certain types of rated titles. This can give us a better understanding of what types of movies different locations prefer and maybe give us a bit more understanding of the different cultures.
