Hypothesis testing using chi-squared test to understand which countries lean towards making certain types of rated titles

# Netflix Title's Hypothesis Test

## Introduction about background:

I am a very big fan of film and TV and was able to find a dataset on Kaggle that showed information of all the Netflix titles. I also think that TV is a cultural representation of different people just as art is. If we investigate this data, we can to an extent understand what the different cultures are like. I wanted to use this dataset to get a deeper understanding of the difference in American and foreign TV. I will be performing a Chi squared test between the country the title was made and rating of the title.

## Why is this business problem interesting?

We can see if countries lean towards making certain types of rated titles. This can give us a better understanding of what types of movies different locations prefer and maybe give us a bit more understanding of the different cultures.
The original data set: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

### Method used: 
Chi-squared test

Take a look at the jupyter notebook for a better presentation fo the project:

### Hypothesis Test:
H0: There is no relationship between the country making the title and the rating of the title. (INDEPENDENT)
Ha: There is relationship between the country making the title and the rating of the title. (DEPENDENT)

### Conclusion:
We reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the country making the title and the rating of the title because the p-value was far less than the default critical value. We can say that there is most definitely a relationship between the rating of a title and where it was made. People from different cultures like to make certain types of movies and that is very understandable and give a vague reflection of their culture.
